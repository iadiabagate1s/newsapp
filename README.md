Description - This is a news website, It gets you the headlines based on Location
or searched terms by the user 
without a profile a user can just have access to those 2 features by either entering a country in the main search bar or 
by searching a word in the search input.
If they sign up they gain access to being able to save articles and save keywords or search terms so that when
they revisit the site articles are already loaded based on those.

This was built using 3 API's , Open weather for the weather widget, Mapquest place search API
and a newsapi. 
This was Built with Python and Flask for the backend , PostgreSQl database and JS/HTML/CSS for the
front end. I enjoyed building this because i was always skeptical on how I would handle large amounts 
of data and this was a great way to really learn to manage and interact with multiple data and pieces of 
information simultaneously
